			<h2>Data Analysis</h2>
			<p>
				<!-- Added anchor tags from The New York Campaign Finance Board to confirm source -->
				An analysis of the <a href="https://www.nyccfb.info//">New York City Campaign Finance Board</a> (NYCCFB) expenditure data reveals major differences in campaign strategy among candidates, particularly between Mamdani and Cuomo, and overall investment in campaign workers.
			</p>
		
			<p>
				Mamdani devoted approximately 20% of his total spending to campaign workers, where Cuomo, on the other hand, put only 1.5 % of his budget—roughly $190,000. 
			</p>

			<p>
				This spending gap is crucial. It suggests that Mamdani’s campaign relied on a grassroots network, whereas Cuomo prioritized other centralized expenses over on-the-ground staff. 
			</p>
		
			<p>
				The breakdown of Cuomo’s expenditures further highlights this difference in priorities. About $2 million of his spending was categorized as “other expenses” per NYCCFB data, which included roughly $530,000 in digital buy and about $280,000 on live calls and canvassing. This shows Cuomo’s preference for digital outreach and mass advertising over paying a staff of organizers.

			<p>
				For comparison, Sliwa, who had the lowest total spending of the three, still allocated about $450,000 to campaign workers. This is significantly more than Cuomo did, despite Sliwa having fewer resources, indicating another strategy priority in overall campaign spending.

			<h2>External Influence</h2>
			<p>
				Political analysts have noted the effectiveness of Mamdani’s spending priorities. David Smith, The Guardian’s D.C. bureau chief, wrote that Democrats' ground game, built on this grassroots approach, resulted in a successful campaign.
			</p>

			<p>
				“Mamdani was a shoe-leather candidate who put himself all over the city, talked to countless voters, projected optimism without sounding preachy, and had thousands of volunteers knocking on doors multiple times,” said Smith.
			</p>


			<p>
				Cuomo’s campaign benefited immensely from wealthy, outside support, with the Super PAC Fix The City—backed by billionaires, including Michael Bloomberg—pouring money into Cuomo's ad campaign.
			</p>

			<p>
				According to findings from Politico, <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2025/06/18/bloomberg-donation-cuomo-super-pac-00413966">the super PAC supporting Cuomo spent more than $14.8 million on TV ads—including $5.4 million just for anti-Mamdani messaging</a>—separate from Cuomo’s own campaign expenditures. </p>
